                            <li><p>How is diabetes diagnosed?</p></li>
                              <p>Diabetes is diagnosed when a blood glucose test measures more than 126 mg/dl (fasting) or 200 mg/dl (two hours after consuming a glucose drink) or a random blood glucose over 200 with diabetic symptoms. The test should be repeated to confirm results. Some doctors may order a glucose tolerance test, in which you drink a glucose solution and have your blood sugar tested before and every hour after for 4 hours. The hemoglobin A1C test is now approved for diagnosing diabetes (now used for diabetes management). An “A 1C” of 6.5 percent or greater is an indication of diabetes. People with risk factors for diabetes - family history, excess weight, high LDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides - should be tested regularly.</p>
                        <li><p>What is the A1C test?</p></li>

                            <p> The A1C (also called HbA1c) is a blood test shows how blood sugar levels were controlled over the previous two to three months. It should be done by your doctor at least twice a year. Aim for a level below 6.5. </p>

                           <li> <P>Can diabetes go away?</P></li>
                   <P>Currently no cure exists for diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a deficiency of the pancreas to produce insulin, so insulin injections are necessary to sustain life. Type 2 diabetes is more common; the pancreas can produce some insulin, but not enough for the diet and size of the body, and/or the insulin functions poorly due to insulin resistance. Research has shown that healthy lifestyle changes such as weight loss and exercise can decrease the need for medication for type 2 diabetes. Even if symptoms diminish and blood glucose measures normal, the disease is still present. Your risk of complications of diabetes is lower if your blood glucose control is improved.</P>
                 <li><p>Do I have to give up sugar?</p></li>
                      <p>No, you can find a way to use sugar sparingly in your diet. Sugar is a carbohydrate, and all carbohydrates raise blood sugar. The amount and type of carbohydrate, as well as what else you eat with it, will alter the rise of blood sugar in speed and level. The goal of blood glucose control is to keep blood sugar between 90 and 140 mg/dl.  A healthy balanced diet, portion control and blood sugar monitoring can help you achieve these goals while including most foods in your diet.  Some people use the glycemic index of foods to better understand the effect of food on their blood glucose. </p>
                    <li><p>Does diabetes cause other complications?</p></li>
                       <p>If blood sugar is not kept in check, diabetes can lead to a number of serious complications, including heart attacks, strokes, kidney disease, blindness, blood vessel disease that can require amputations, nerve damage and impotence in men. However, a recent study conducted over a 10-year period showed that patients can reduce the risk of complications by 50% or more when their blood sugar measures as close to normal as possible.</p>
                    <li><p>How does my blood pressure affect diabetes?</p></li>
                      <p>High blood pressure poses a risk for strokes. Since diabetics have a higher risk for strokes, you should check your blood pressure twice a year. If your blood pressure is higher than 130/80, discuss it with your doctor. If pressure remains high, consider treatment options such as a low-sodium diet, increased exercise and/or taking blood pressure medication.</p>
                    <li><p>How should I take care of my eyes and feet?</p></li>
                     <p>As a diabetic, you risk eye and foot problems, so check both regularly. In particular, it is critical that you get a yearly eye exam that includes dilating your pupils to detect signs of eye disease. Diabetics face a higher risk of eye complications, such as retinopathy, macular edema, and cataracts.

                      Your doctor should check your feet at least once a year. Symptoms of foot problems can include decreased feeling in the feet, cramps when walking, cuts and scratches that heal slowly, redness in the feet when sitting and whiteness when propped up, lack of hair growth on legs and feet and leg or feet pain. Doctors advise daily checks for cuts or injuries in order to prevent infection or other problems.</p>
                    <li><p>Do I have to take insulin?</p></li>
                      <p>People with type 1 diabetes must take insulin to sustain life. People with type 2 diabetes either produce inadequate insulin or have insulin resistance (which means the cells have difficulty responding to insulin) or both. Treatment for type 2 usually begins with a change in diet and exercise. However, very overweight, inactive newly diagnosed people with diabetes may have such a high blood glucose level that they may initially need insulin to bring blood glucose under control. Many people with type 2 diabetes can manage their diabetes with lifestyle changes and oral medications. Diabetes is a progressive disease, and in spite of a person’s best efforts, he may need insulin to control blood glucose at some time.</p>
                    <li><p>Why is my blood sugar high in the morning?</p></li>

                      <p>This early morning rise in glucose, known as the “dawn phenomenon” is normal and happens when our bodies produce a surge of hormones to help us wake up. During the day, activity tends to keep sugars under control if following a healthy, active lifestyle. If using insulin, it may help to adjust your nighttime dosage.</p>
                    <li><p>Can stress increase blood sugar levels? </p></li>

                          <p>Stress can elevate blood sugar, and if you are already requiring insulin when you are otherwise unstressed, you may need more at these times. Be sure to monitor yourself in all situations as closely as you can.</p>
                    <li><p>When is the best time to test my blood sugar?</p></li>

                        <p>Most people with well-controlled diabetes who are not taking medications need to have their blood sugar checked only 2 - 3 times a week. Monitoring 2 - 4 times a day is necessary for most individuals with diabetes in order to track the changes that may occur. People with diabetes who are ill, have more than two insulin shots a day, or are pregnant, may need to check blood sugar even more often. The best times to do this are before breakfast, lunch, and dinner, at bedtime, and 1 - 2 hours after meals.</p>
